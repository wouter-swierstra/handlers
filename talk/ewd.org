The day was closed by P. Martin-LÃ¶f on "Constructive mathematics and
computer programming". I quote from his abstract ".... it no longer
seems possible to distinguish the discipline of programming from
constructive mathematics. [...] the intuitionistic theory of types
[...], which was originally developed as a symbolism for the precise
codification of constructive mathematics, may equally well be viewed
as a programming language. [...] the inference rules of the theory of
types, which are again completely formal, appear as rules for correct
program synthesis. Thus the correctness of a program written in the
theory of types is proved formally at the same time as it is being
synthesized." But the 50 minutes were not enough to introduce an
ignorant audience to intuitionistic type theory to the extent that it
could follow a comparison with Scottery. He was a very sympathetic
speaker and convinced at least me that something (possibly even of
great conceptual elegance) was going on. He spoke with an endearing
care.
